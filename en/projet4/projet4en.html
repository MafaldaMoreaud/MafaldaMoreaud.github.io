            <div class="explication">
            This project is an experiment on the theme of perceptions and vision. How can vision translate what we perceive into action? <br>
            What are the limits between the visible, the "possibilities" of the vision, the perceptible and the perceived? To what extent <br>
            will the interpretation, the feeling of the person and what she knows about a place, influence the perception she has of it<br>
            and the transcription she will be able to make of it? This project deals with the relationship to places, to space, but also to the idea<br>
            of the present moment, of what marks a moment in time and space and which « defines", in a certain way, when it begins and when <br>
            it ends. This is perhaps what one might call paradoxically a kind of constant ephemeral experience … Lights are a key element of these <br>
            experiences in space. They signal it, make it special and project us into different worlds and atmospheres. The limits of translation add <br>
            to this production and onto all forms of interpretations which follow from what I am are projected my perception of this space. <br>
            No matter how hard I try to represent the perceived moment, I will never really be able to reproduce it in its entirety.<br>
            On the one hand because this moment implies a movement and a position which themselves induce a temporality. Moreover these short <br>
            moments are special precisely because they are limited in time. Consequently, my sensitivity, and all that I project in it, will unconsciously <br>
            influence the form that I give to this translation. It would be like a a total fabrication of what is real, if we can talk about<br>
            reality at all. In the end, everything is about perception and not about reality. The series deals with the the theme of interior / exterior <br>
            and explores a certain range of possibilities over terms of lights and colors. The micro animations performed give the impression <br>
            of a change in time, movement. The light seems to turn in space. It is an attempt to imagine what this moment might have been. <br>
            They have to be watched together to experience the total effect.

            « What’s the point, when it’s all about <br>
            realising that our eyes are already much <br>
            more than receivers for lights, colors and lines: <br>
            computers of the world, and who have the gift <br>
            of the visible as we say that the inspired man <br>
            has the gift of language. Of course, this gift <br>
            is earned by practise, and it is not in a few months,<br>
            nor is it in solitude that a painter comes into <br>
            possession of his vision.<br>
            That is not the question: early or late, <br>
            spontaneous or formed in the museum, his vision <br>
            in any case develops only by seeing, <br>
            only learns from itself. »<br>
