            <div class="explication">
              Project executed during a workshop with Adrien Zammit from the collective "Formes Vives" and in collaboration with Clémence Estingoy. <br>
              The central isuue of the project was to (re) think the diffusion of articles by the news website <u><i>Lundi-Matin</i></u>. How to make digital content <br>
              accessible? Thinking about others reading contexts. Bringing meaning through form. We chose to bring together two articles, one of which <br>
              is <u><i>« A hundred ways to disappear »</i></u>, which poetically addresses the theme of hyperconnectivity and the impossibility of escaping from it, <br>
              as well as <u><i>« Experiences of autonomous communes in warn-torn Syria »</i></u> in an easily transportable edition.  <br>
              The edition deals with two different attitudes to reality, and so different ways of dealing with it. They question humanity but also the place<br>
              of human beings. Loneliness, pressure from society, communication and the need, if not the will, to escape are recurring themes. Both of <br>
              these articles stress the importance of the organizations set up to deflect what is in fact an imposed reality. The message is conveyed <br>
              in a light and non-judgmental way to make it accessible to a wider audience. On the face of it, these two articles seem to have nothing<br>
              in common but we can compare them thanks to the editorial composition. We each worked on one article and then, subsequently, <br>
              we intervened on each other production. Its layout allows the reader to juggle from one article to another while establishing links <br>
              between them. A colorful principle is put in place to differentiate the two articles and our interventions. Over the course of the editions <br>
              echoes are produced between them. This layout allows another interpretation of these articles that usually would probably not have been <br>
              put side by side.
