            <div class="explication">
            Project based on the theme of know-how and its future. This edition reports a meeting with Gérard Depeyris. It aims to bring <br>
            a different perspective on the know-how and encourages us to reappropriate time. The time to meet, share, exchange, enjoy, watch, <br>
            listen, produce,experiment, change, make, undo and redo… What emerges from this meeting is the very close link between Gérard's <br>
            philosophy of life, the way he practices his profession and being a surfer himself. The three are indissociable and occupy the same place. <br>
            This consideration encourages us to treat the text, the image and the sketch with the same importance. In any case, to consider <br>
            the typographic character or the typographical gray as a visual material. Contrasts are set up thanks to the texts as well as two different <br>
            relation to these. There is Gerard's speech and then the reported speech. And so, there is some kind of a game of back and forth between <br>
            his words and mine that can intermittentlydynamize the visual. Through this information processing, a spatiality is also transcribed, linked to <br>
            the movements, but also to the displacements of the body required in the manufacturing of a board and to the rhythm of the production that<br>
            we find in gestures. The text enclosed in a column too narrow for the chosen type size, entrails an unusual and usually "forbidden" flag effect…<br>
            Through this treatment, the eye travels through the typographic blanks. The text then takes on a more poetic dimension that works with <br>
            the contemplative aspect desired for this edition. There are several levels of reading, one "functional" then another wich is purely poetic<br>
            and contemplative. I evoke a contemplative dimension because in my eyes surfing belongs to another temporality. A different temporality <br>
            to move, to look, to apprehend an environment. In this sport as in the profession of shaper, the eye, the visible, the perceived or even <br>
            the perceptible are of great importance. The eye decodes, and allows us to transcribe in gestures and forms. The pages are not connected <br>
            to each other. The reader can manipulate them together, as they were conceive, but also alone or in a very random order. In this case, what <br>
            happens? Are connections made? Is the mood still there? The photographs of the edition are not illustrations of the text. They are part <br>
            of the encounter, they tell another story. A story without words, just feelings, colors and moods. The sketches provide details mainly <br>
            of the characteristic gestures. Despite the fact that the text is treated as a material, a "sensitivity" is still brought to Gérard's speech <br>
            and phrasing. Some cuts are not insignificant. They make sense, support the meaning of certain words, the rhythm of speech, or the tone used.
